                <h2>What is Civic Sense?</h2>
                <p>Civic sense refers to the awareness, responsibility, and behavior of individuals towards their community and society at large. It encompasses understanding one's rights and duties as a citizen, respecting public property, following laws and regulations, and actively participating in community welfare. A strong civic sense promotes harmony, cleanliness, safety, and overall development of the society. It encourages people to be mindful of their actions and their impact on others, fostering a culture of respect, cooperation, and social responsibility.</p>
                <p>Having civic sense means being considerate in public spaces, such as not littering, obeying traffic rules, helping others in need, and contributing positively to the community. It is essential for building a healthy, sustainable, and progressive society where everyone can thrive.</p>
